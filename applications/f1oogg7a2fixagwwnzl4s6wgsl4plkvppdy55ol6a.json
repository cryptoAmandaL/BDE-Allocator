    "Brief history of your project and organization": "UCAR is a hub for the Earth system sciences and a gateway to cutting-edge resources and services. Our team help save this dataset and choose filecoin as a safe way.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "ARISE-SAI-1.5 simulations include extensive output for the atmospheric, land, ocean and sea-ice model components. All model output for the simulations is in NetCDF format. All variables are in time-series format, with one variable per file. 3-dimensional atmospheric output is on the original 70 model levels. Output consists of standard monthly mean CMIP6 output for the atmospheric, land, ocean, and sea-ice models. In addition, higher-frequency (daily averaged, 3-hourly averaged, 3-hourly instantaneous, and 1-hourly mean) output is available for the atmospheric model. A listing of all output variables is available (output follows member 006 - 010 of the reference simulations described below).",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We've downloaded this dataset into our storage servers. Then we would provide download links to sps.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "s3://ncar-cesm2-arise/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, Australia (continent)",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01841134 China/f02029743 Singapore/f0420161 Canada/f02239446 HK/f01844118 US",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
