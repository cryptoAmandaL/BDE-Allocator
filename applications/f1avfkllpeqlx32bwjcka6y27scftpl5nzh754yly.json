    "Brief history of your project and organization": "This dataset captures Sunflower's genetic diversity originating from thousands of wild, cultivated, and landrace sunflower individuals distributed across North America. The data consists of raw sequences and associated botanical metadata, aligned sequences (to three different reference genomes), and sets of SNPs computed across several cohorts.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "This dataset allows the genetic study of the germplasm (i.e. seed) of 2392 Sunflowers (a mix of wild, landrace, and cultivated varieties), from multiple species, collected from diverse ecosystems throughout North America. Plants were grown in a common garden experiment (in greenhouse), and then whole-genome-sequenced over a total of 3523 Illumina HiSeq runs. All the plants involved are associated with curated metadata in NCBI’s Short Read Archive (SRA), where the raw source data is currently available.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "After I finished downloading the dataset，I use lotus to make the data into car files. Then I transfer these files to SP online and by sending harddisk.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "s3://ubc-sunflower-genome/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01074953 China\r\nf02086562 Hubei\r\nf02250267 Henan\r\nf01520 Denmark\r\nf02816050 USA\r\nf03027241 HK",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
